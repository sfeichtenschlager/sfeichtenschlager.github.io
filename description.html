        <p>Landscape photography shows the spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. 
            Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of 
            landscapes. Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most common is to recall a personal 
            observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling. Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor 
            lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world. Many landscape 
            photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of nature, 
            devoid of human influenceâ€”instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. 
            As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad and may include rural or urban settings, 
            industrial areas or nature photography.</p>
